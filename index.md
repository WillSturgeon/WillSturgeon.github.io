I'm a post doctoral research fellow in global seismology at University College London (UCL). My research focuses on high-resolution imaging of the Earth's mantle and crust using surface wave measurements, particularly focusing on imaging mantle anisotropy and attenuation. I'm also interested in constraining geodynamic models with seismic observations.

### Research interests

* Global seismic tomography, attenuation, radial anisotropy
* Inverse theory, big data, global optimisation
* Constraining geodynamics using seismology

### Education

* Ph.D. in Seismology, University College London (UCL), 2022
* MSci in Geophysics, University College London (UCL), 2017

### Fieldwork

I took part in a four-week field campaign installing and retrieving 10 broadband seismometers in the Azores archipelago in response to the seismic swarm in March 2022. I wrote a blog on the experience, which you can find <a href="https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sm/2023/01/09/azores-seismic-deployment-2022/" target="_blank">here.</a>
